Demo about using selenium in java


## Update 2017-03-29
On account of geckodriver have not implemented Actions yet, I add an example about using jsExecutor to execute js to simulate mouse click action.

The js script is copied from here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6157929/how-to-simulate-a-mouse-click-using-javascript
